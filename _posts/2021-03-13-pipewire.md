title: Using pipewire
---
Some personal notes on the alternative audio server.
---

I've seen a lot of talk about [pipewire](https://pipewire.org/#about) recently, particularly given the proposal to [route all audio to pipewire](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DefaultPipeWire) for Fedora 34, so I figured I'd try it out. Since switching audio stacks would usually be a pretty daunting task, I've documented my process below. (as it turns out, switching to pipewire is incredibly simple, so this is more of a personal reference than anything.)

## Installation
Installing pipewire is just a case of using your package manager:
```
yay -S pipewire
```
If you'd like to use pipewire as a replacement for pulseaudio, or to run [JACK software](https://jackaudio.org/), install the relevant plugins to replace those sound systems:
```
yay -S pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack
```
Their systemd services should already be enabled, but it can't hurt to make sure:
```
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire-media-session pipewire-pulse pipewire
```
This should be all that's required. It may be worth rebooting to ensure that the pulseaudio/JACK daemons aren't still running, but that's it! You'll still be able to use software that depends on pulse/JACK as if you had those servers running.

## Practical uses
If you have both `pipewire-pulse` and `pipewire-jack` installed, your pulseaudio sinks will appear in JACK software natively. This offers some promising prospects with using software for either system interchangeably.

For example, you could use [Catia](https://kx.studio/Applications:Catia), the JACK transport patchbay, to visualise your pulseaudio sinks and route audio intuitively with its graph-based patchbay:
