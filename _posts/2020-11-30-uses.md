A list of things I like using regularly.
---

## Keyboard
I use a mechanical keyboard - the [Ducky One 2 Skyline TKL](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Skyline-TKL) - with MX blue switches.

## Audio
I have a pair of [ATH-M50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/ath-m50x)s, with a [ModMic](https://antlionaudio.com/products/modmic-uni) stuck on.

## Shell
My shell is [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), with the [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) plugin manager. (I also source [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) later on in my `~/.zshrc`, but only for the few QoL things I can't find in other plugins)

You can see the list of plugins I use in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jerbob/dotfiles/blob/master/terminal/zsh/zshrc#L11-L20).
