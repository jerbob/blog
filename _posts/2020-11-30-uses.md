A collection of things I like using regularly.
---

## Shell
My shell is [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), with the [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) plugin manager. (I also source [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) later on in my ~/.zshrc, but only for the few QoL things I can't find in other plugins)

You can see the list of plugins I use in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jerbob/dotfiles/blob/master/terminal/zsh/zshrc#L11-L20).

## Terminal Emulator / Font
When I'm actually working, I just use uxterm with [Ypnose's](https://ywstd.fr/p/pj/) excellent envypn font. It's a tiny bitmap font that gives me plenty of breathing room for vertical and horizontal code splits, even on the tiny laptop monitors that I use most often.

When I'm not particularly in need of screen real estate, I'm prone to font-hopping every other day. My current choice is [Relative Mono 11 Pitch](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/relative/) at around 20px.

## System
My operating system of choice is currently [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/), and my window manager is [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm). I have no swap, instead opting for [earlyoom](https://github.com/rfjakob/earlyoom) to handle OOMs for me. I try and keep my system clean and simple, running only what I need.

## Editor
My preferred editor is [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), the hyperextensible Vim-based text editor. I use it alongside [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for VSCode-style completions. Auto-imports and static typechecking are provided by [coc-pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright), a coc.nvim port of Microsoft's [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). This workflow gives me some of the smartness of a fully-fledged IDE, while staying as close to the terminal experience as possible.

## Packages
Since I primarily write (and work) in Python, these will all be Python libraries and/or utilities:
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

  I use poetry to set up any new generic project. It's a great dependency resolver and project manager that hides a lot of the complexity involved in [publishing your own packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

- [django-stubs](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs)
  
  If you're not familiar with type-checked python, go [watch this](https://youtu.be/pMgmKJyWKn8). django-stubs is a package containing type stubs for your type checker, allowing it to more accurately resolve types for things that use Django's internal metaclass magicks. Invaluable for any type-hinter working on Django projects.

## Keyboard
I use a mechanical keyboard - the [Ducky One 2 Skyline TKL](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Skyline-TKL) - with MX blue switches.

## Audio
I have a pair of [ATH-M50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/ath-m50x)s, with a [ModMic](https://antlionaudio.com/products/modmic-uni) stuck on.
