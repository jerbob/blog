A list of things I like using regularly.

## Keyboard
I use a mechanical keyboard - the [Ducky One 2 Skyline TKL](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Skyline-TKL) - with MX blue switches.

## Audio
I have a pair of [ATH-M50x](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-gb/ath-m50x)s, with a [Modmic](https://antlionaudio.com/products/modmic-uni) stuck on.
